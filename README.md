# Car-Price-Prediction-Model

The Car Price Prediction Model is a linear regression project that aims to provide an estimate of a car's price based on several factors. The model takes input of various features such as the year of the car, its fuel type, the number of kilometers driven, and the current market price of similar cars.
A linear regression model is built using the preprocessed data to analyze the relationship between the car's features and its price. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and tested on another portion to ensure accuracy and reliability.Once the model is trained and tested, it can be used to predict the price of a car.
Overall, this Car Price Prediction Model project provides a valuable tool for both buyers and sellers in the used car market. It can help buyers make informed decisions about the value of a car, and it can assist sellers in pricing their vehicles competitively.

This project is deployed on streamlit.
